Welcome to my blog, amigos! My name is F. Javier R. Donado, I was born in Madrid (Spain), and I moved to Stuttgart (Germany) in September 2012.

I've been [writing software](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LfmrkyP81M) since the early 2000s. My favorite programming languages are TypeScript, Python, and Kotlin, although I've used many more over the years (Java, JavaScript, C++, Clojure, PHP, Perl...). My focus is web development (full-stack) and mobile apps.

I have a master's in [Telecom Engineering](https://www.uc3m.es/master/telecommunication-engineering) and currently, I work as a Software Architect at [Porsche Digital](https://www.porsche.digital/) in Ludwigsburg.

I love flexible & scalable architectures, DDD, functional programming, the AWS cloud, Docker, VIM, Visual Studio Code, and the clicky sound of a mechanical keyboard.

In addition to writing software, I [take pictures](https://www.flickr.com/photos/79693661@N05/), I pile up guitars, and [I compose music in my home studio](https://fractalfields.bandcamp.com/). For more information, [visit my website](https://www.jdonado.com).

Auf wiedersehen!
