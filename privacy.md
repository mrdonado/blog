# Privacy Policy for Apps Published by Jdonado

**Introduction**

At Jdonado, we are committed to protecting the privacy of our users. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle any user data in relation to the mobile applications published under the name Jdonado, developed by F. Javier R. Donado. Our apps are designed to provide services primarily offline and do not aim to collect or process user data beyond what is necessary for functionality, advertising, or in-app purchases.

**1. Data Collection and Usage**

Our apps are designed with user privacy in mind and do not intentionally collect any personal data from users. However, certain data may be collected by third-party services used within the apps:

- **Advertisements:** Our apps may include advertisements provided by third-party ad networks. These networks may collect certain data to deliver personalized ads based on user interactions and preferences. Please refer to the respective ad network’s privacy policy for more details on data collection practices.
- **In-App Purchases:** For in-app purchases, we may use third-party payment processors (such as those provided by Google Play Store and Apple App Store). These processors handle payment information and other data in accordance with their own privacy policies.

**2. Data Sharing**

We do not share any personal data directly with third parties. Any data shared through third-party services such as ad networks or in-app purchase providers is governed by those services' privacy policies.

**3. Children’s Privacy**

Our apps are not specifically targeted at children under 13 years of age. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided personal information through our apps, please contact us so that we can take necessary action.

**4. Third-Party Services**

Our apps may use third-party services, including but not limited to ad networks and payment processors. These services have their own privacy policies that dictate how user data is collected and used. We recommend reviewing these policies to understand their data practices.

**5. User Control and Data Security**

Users have control over their interactions with the app. As we do not directly collect user data, there are no specific user data management features. Any data collected by third-party services is subject to their security measures.

**6. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected with an updated effective date. We encourage users to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting user data.

**7. Contact Information**

If you have any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact F. Javier R. Donado at <privacy@jdonado.com>.

**Conclusion**

We are committed to providing apps that prioritize user privacy. By using our apps, you agree to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy.
