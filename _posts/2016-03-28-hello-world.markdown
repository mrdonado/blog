## What is jdonado.com? 

[Jdonado.com](http://www.jdonado.com) is my personal page, [blog.jdonado.com](http://blog.jdonado.com) is this blog, and you're very welcome to them both.

My name is F. Javier R. Donado, I'm from Madrid (Spain) and I live in Stuttgart (Germany). I'm a software developer, and I also take pictures and record music.

In my [blog](http://blog.jdonado.com) I write mostly about software development. In [jdonado.com](http://www.jdonado.com) I describe my experience as a software developer, I show my pictures and my music, and I write about it all.

## How did you do it?

I used AngularJS to develop [www.jdonado.com](http://www.jdonado.com). So actually, it's not exactly a just page but a web app.

This blog is based in [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and uses a slightly modified [Travelogue](https://github.com/SalGnt/Travelogue) template.

Both projects are open source, so feel free to visit me on [GitHub](https://github.com/fjrd84). Any feedback will be appreciated.

## Did you do it all?

For what you can see in [www.jdonado.com](http://www.jdonado.com), mostly yes. Of course I used some plugins and snippets (I don't think reinventing the wheel is a good idea), but apart from that, I took care about the rest (code, design, image editing...). I like to use it as a playground to try out new ideas. Check the [Special Thanks]({% link _posts/2016-06-12-special-thanks.markdown %}) post for more information.
