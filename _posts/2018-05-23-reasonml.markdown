# ReasonML Programming Language

## What is ReasonML? Where does it come from? What can I do with it?

ReasonML is an object-functional programming language that provides a different syntax for writing [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/) code and can be transpiled into JavaScript code using [BuckleScript](https://bucklescript.github.io/). A comparison between OCaml and ReasonML can be found on [ReasonML's official documentation](https://reasonml.github.io/docs/en/comparison-to-ocaml.html).

The ReasonML programming language was created at Facebook and I found out about it thanks to [Nick Graf](https://twitter.com/nikgraf)'s Egghead course [Get Started with Reason](https://egghead.io/courses/get-started-with-reason). I started taking notes while watching the course and I ended up with this post (so thank him for the code examples).

If you want to know more about the language, Dr. Axel Rauschmayer has written a wonderful book about it that you can read online for free: [Exploring ReasonML and functional programming](http://reasonmlhub.com/exploring-reasonml/).

## What I Like and Dislike so Far

I like...

- Inferred types
- The possibility of creating custom types and variants
- The compiler warns you if your switches are not exhaustive (if you're forgetting cases)
- Code suggestions underneath the command line are cool
- Compatibility with JS and OCaml
- Lexical scoping
- `If` is an expression that can be evaluated into a value (in other languages it is only an statement)
- Syntax of switch expressions
- Objects (or records) defined in a similar way as in TypeScript
- Destructuring objects (records) in a similar way as in JavaScript
- Spread operator as in JavaScript
- Combinations of variants with switch expressions are great
- You can match specific cases in a switch
- There's no null: variants None and Some can be used instead
- You can partially apply arguments in functions (automatic currying)
- Labeled parameters (you can apply then in any order you want)
- Optional parameters
- Pipe operator for function composition
- Nested structures can directly be compared for equality
- Structural `==` and referential equality `===` operators
- Powerful pattern matching

I dislike...

- Shadowing is allowed (let variables can be redefined)
- Operator ++ for concatenating strings
- Underscores in the built-in functions' names
- Too many semicolons

## Code Examples

{% highlight javascript %}

let foo = {
  let a = 40;
  let b = 1;
  a + b + 1;
}; // this will bind 42 to the name `foo`

let isMorning = true;
// This binds "Good Morning" to the name `greeting`
let greeting = if (isMorning) {"Good Morning"} else {"Hello"};

// A switch expression
let greeting = stranger =>
  switch (stranger) {
    | Teacher => "Hey professor"
    | Director => "Hello director"
    | Student("Richard") => "Still here Ricky?"
    | Student(anyOtherName) => "Hey, " ++ anyOtherName ++ "."
    | _ => "unknown"
  };

// A person type definition
type person = {
  name: string,
  age: int,
  mutable mood: string, // mood is the only mutable field in this type
};

// A record of type person
let tim = {
  name: "Tim",
  age: 52,
  mood: "happy"
};

// Destructuring a person type into variables timsAge and timsName
let {age: timsAge, name: timsName} = tim;

// Custom type answer (tagged union or variant)
type answer =
  | Yes
  | No
  | Maybe;

// Further assignments automatically infer the type
let isItRaining = Maybe; // It infers type `answer`

// You can define functions like this (in this case, types are optional, since they
// can be inferred
let add: (x: int, y: int) : int => x + y;

// A function with labelled and optional parameters
let name = (~firstName="Defaultname", ~middleName=?, ~lastName, ()) => {
  switch (middleName) {
  | Some(value) => firstName ++ " " ++ value ++ " " ++ lastName
  | None => firstName ++ " " ++ lastName
  };
};

// Pipe operators example: find the largest element smaller than 4
[8, 3, 6, 1]
  |> List.sort(compare)
  |> List.rev
  |> List.find(x => x < 4);

// Recursive functions (without rec, the function cannot call itself)
let rec countBack = x => {
  if (x > 1) {
    print_int(x);
    countBack(x - 1);
  };
};

// There are tuples too (unlike lists, they can contain elements of different types)
("this is", 1, "tuple", "of four elements")

// And there are arrays. Unlike lists, they're mutable
[|3, 4|]

// A pattern matching example
switch ([|"a", "b", "c"|]) {
| [|"a", "b", _|] => print_endline("a, b and something")
| [|_, x, y|] => print_endline("something and " ++ x ++ " " ++ y)
| _ => print_endline("An Array")
};

// Example Math module
module Math = {
  let pi = 3.1415;
  let add = (x, y) => x + y;
};

// Then access everything using dot notation
Math.pi; // Returns 3.1415
